Work experience
======

**Machine Learning Engineer – ORISE Fellow | FDA | Washington DC| June 2022 - Present**
  * Contributing to the development of an open-source deep unsupervised learning library ([**DomId**](https://github.com/DIDSR/DomId.git))
  * Developed three deep learning algorithms for conditional and contextual identification hidden subgroups in the digital pathology datasets assisting in bias reduction
  * Performed regulatory science research to assess the generalizability of ML models, which resulted in multiple scientific publications at top-tier ML conferences
  * Received ***"Outstanding Young Researcher"*** award ([LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mariia-sidulova_i-think-i-got-fda-approved-while-true-activity-7085628722166276097-XEE1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop))

**Researcher | George Washington University | Washington DC| September 2019 - December 2023**
  * Developed deep generative models (VAEs, DDPMs) to detect abnormal brain connectivity, which reduced sex-related bias compared to existing solutions
  * Contributed to the development of a state-of-the-art robust multimodal emotion recognition system using Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), WaveRNN, and FaceNet+RNN
  * Implemented explainable AI algorithms for EEG signals for early diagnosis of dementia with 80% confidence 
  * Designed an AI-based robotic system for stroke detection that can be scaled up for in-hospital use

**Teaching Assistant | George Washington University | Washington DC | September 2019 – May 2022**
  *  Guided 8 - 10 team projects through the process of engineering medical devices for real* world clients
  *  Introduced students to principles of SCRUM project management, product development, and customer discovery
  *  Assisted students with Python, SolidWorks, 3D printing, microcontrollers, circuit design, and digital signal processing
  *  Recieved ***"Outstandin Teaching"*** award ([LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mariia-sidulova_those-who-can-do-those-who-cant-teach-activity-7018267035457523712-Vp24?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop))

**Biomedical Engineering Intern | InSitu Technologies Inc | St. Paul, MN | February 2019 – May 2019**
  *  Performed experiments to aid the design and development of new products for treatment of aneurysms
  *  Automated process of statistical analysis of test data which reduced data processing time by 10 hours/week
  *  Wrote and executed process validation protocols and technical reports

**Research Assistant | University of Minnesota | Minneapolis, MN | September 2018 – December 2018**
  *  Analyzed the magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from patients with Parkinson’s disease
  *  Applied traditional machine learning algorithms (LDA, SVM, linear regression) to uncover the correlation between measured brain activity and changes in a behavioral task 

**Math Teaching Assistant | University of Minnesota | Minneapolis, MN | January 2016 – May 2019**
  *  Organized and led weekly recitations sessions for ~60 students/semester for pre* calculus, calculus classes
  *  Graded homework, exams, quizzes and reported statistics of students’ performance
  *  Hosted office hours and appointment based tutoring sessions
