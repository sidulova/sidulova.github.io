About
======
Hello! My name is Mariia and I am currently a PhD student at George Washington University and ORISE Fellow at Food and Drug Administration. My doctoral research focuses on generative models for functional connectivity analysis of fMRI data. My FDA research project is about unsupervised clustering algorithms for domain identification in medical imaging. When I am not coding, or writing a paper draft, I love to play tennis, snowboard, explore art and go to standup shows.
